<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Fetal Alchohol Spectrum Disorder module for Cliniface is based upon the diagnostic assessment
methodology using the FASD 4-Digit Code for 2D images of faces developed by Susan J. (Astley) Hemingway,
Ph.D, Professor of Epidemiology / Pediatrics, and Director, WA State FAS Diagnostic &amp; Prevention
Network <a href="http://www.fasdpn.org">(FAS DPN)</a>.
In Cliniface, this methodology which was originally developed for use with 2D photos is used to
evaluate facial features in 3D images. The approach has not been validated for use with 3D images,
so results should not be interpreted as having the same degree of accuracy or reliability as when
used to evaluate facial photographs in accordance with the original protocol using 2D photos.
Dr. Hemingway, nor any of her affiliates are responsible for any aspect of this module in Cliniface.
</p>

<h2>Using the FASD module</h2>
<p>The <em>FASD Facial Diagnostics</em> dialog (shown below) can be opened from the <em>Metrics</em> menu.
The option is greyed out unless the selected model has facial landmarks present.
The dialog is segmented into three sections (described below):
<a href="#pfl">Palpebral Fissure Lengths (PFL)</a>,
<a href="#ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</a>, and
<a href="#rankings">University of Washington Facial Diagnostic Ranks</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="pfl">Palpebral Fissure Lengths (PFL)</h2>
<p>The left, right, and mean PFL lengths are shown according to the current model measurements of the
distance between the exocanthian (outer eye) and endocanthian (inner eye) landmarks.
</p>

<p>The Z-scores to the right of the measurement values are calculated according to the currently set
statistics for the PFL. Hovering the mouse over any of the Z-score values shows the source
of the growth curve statistics used to calculate these values. To change the statistics source
(and therefore the Z-scores), open the <em>Measurements Browser</em> from the <em>Metrics</em>
menu, select the PFL metric from the table, uncheck the <em>Subject Match</em> checkbox if checked,
and select the desired source from the dropdown list.
</p>

<p>
All of the statistics in Cliniface provide the measurement as a point-to-point distance between
the canthi of each eye. By checking <em>In-plane</em> in the <em>Measurements Browser</em>, the PFL
distances will be reprojected into the frontal (coronal) plane. These plane projected values will be
smaller by a factor of cos &theta; where &theta; is the angle of incidence between the PFL line and the
coronal plane. The 2D values calculated in this way are comparable to the PFL distances measured from
2D facial photos (not accounting for camera perspective projection error).
A short mean palpebral fissure length results in a higher FASD <a href="#rankings">rank</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</h2>
<p>
Upper lip fullness (or circularity) is calculated as the square of its perimeter by its area.
This metric was originally designed to be used with 2D photos by having the user trace around
the perimeter of the upper vermilion. Larger values denote a thinner upper lip.
In Cliniface, the perimeter of the upper lip is estimated using the landmarks around the upper
vermilion which are <em>Stomion Superius (SS)</em>, <em>Left / Right Mid-labial Fissure Superius (MF)</em>,
<em>Left / Right Cheilion (C)</em>, <em>Left / Right Mid-vermilion Superius (MV)</em>,
<em>Left / Right Crista Philtri (CP)</em>, and <em>Labrale Superius (LS)</em>.
The area is calculated as the sum of the areas of the eight inner triangles as
shown in the diagram below:
</p>

<p>
While the demarcation of the perimeter using these landmarks is not as precise as
tracing the path exactly around the upper vermilion, the major components of the upper lip
contributing to its fullness score are captured. In addition, a 2D image projection
of the upper lip may (depending on the orientation of the mouth) inaccurately show the degree
of curvature of the upper or lower edges of the upper lip as more or less horizontally
curved than in actuality.
The frontal plane projection (simulating measurement from a 2D photo) results in the
fullness metric being calculated differently than in 3D.

<p>
The <em>Ethnicity Guide</em> should be set manually to one of the two available guides:
<em>Caucasian</em>, or <em>African American</em> so that the correct ranking can be scored
by thresholding on the circularity value. The thresholds used are the same as those for the
2D photo guides. More information about these thresholds can be found on page 30 of the
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/guide04.pdf">
    Diagnostic Guide For Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="rankings">University of Washington Facial Diagnostic Ranks</h2>
<p>
The University of Washington's FASD 1-5 ranking system associates a numeric rank
from 1 to 5 with each of the three sentinel features. The philtrum curvature
rank must be manually entered with reference to page 30 of the
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/guide04.pdf">
    Diagnostic Guide For Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Guide</a>
ensuring that the same ethncity guide is used as set in the <a href="#ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</a>
field. The image guides are not included with Cliniface due to copyright restrictions.
</p>

<h2 id="report">Generating the FASD report</h2>
<p>
The FASD report is generated by selecting it from Cliniface's report selection dialog which
is opened by clicking <em>File --> Generate Report</em>. The report summarises the content
of the FASD dialog and embeds the PFL growth curve statistics used as well as a 3D model
of the subject's face together with standard demographic and assessment details.
