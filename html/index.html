<p>
Cliniface gives clinicians the means to interactively visualise, measure, analyse, and export
data about 3D facial images taken of their patients.
A comprehensive range of facial measurements are taken and compared against statistics
of normal facial growth to automatically identify notable phenotypic traits as standard Human Phenotype Ontology
(HPO) terms having disease / gene associations. By combining these HPO terms with other
phenotypic information (including medical / family histories), clinicians are better able
to quickly and accurately arrive at a potential diagnosis for their patients.
The results can be summarised in a PDF report, or exported to CSV or other text formats
for detailed follow-up investigations.
</p>

<p>
Cliniface takes over fifty measurements from different parts of the face including distances,
depth, angles, and asymmetry. Users can also record their own measurements on the facial surface.
For treatment monitoring and other kinds of shape analysis, a second image can be loaded
and all measurements directly compared between the two. Visualisations of asymmetry, difference,
and curvature are also provided to more effectively interpret the facial surface.
</p>

<p>
Cliniface can work with 3D images stored in a wide variety of formats including those without
texture information. Basic tools to help fix aspects of the model's geometry are built-in for
convenience. All processing and analysis is carried out locally on your own machine and
no data are remotely uploaded anywhere thereby ensuring the protection and privacy of yours
and your patient's data.
</p>

<p>
Cliniface is free and open source. Please help us to improve Cliniface and
