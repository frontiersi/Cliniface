<h2 id="1">Does Cliniface diagnose rare diseases?</h2>
<p>
No. More than facial measurements are needed for undertaking a diagnosis since not
all anomalous facial variation is present because of an underlying disease.
Cliniface should be used by health professionals in a clinical setting to gain accurate
objective measurements and indications of facial abnormalities. That information should
then be integrated with other phenotypic information and the patient's medical history
to help a diagnostician come to a better understanding of the patient's possible condition.
</p>

<h2 id="2">Do the images loaded into Cliniface remain private?</h2>
<p>
Yes. Cliniface undertakes all processing locally and doesn't send your data anywhere.
Cliniface only connects to the Internet to receive data about updates.
</p>

<h2 id="3">Why doesn't the loaded 3D image show the facial texture?</h2>
<p>
Usually this is because either the texture was not loaded (it couldn't
be found in the specification of the model), or the model's vertices are stored
incorrectly. If the texture was not loaded then the surface of the model will be
shown without the mapped image. If the vertices are stored incorrectly then the
"front" of the face will be masked from the camera's initial viewpoint - check if
this is the case or not by toggling <em>View --> Backface Culling</em>.
If turning off backface culling allows the front surface of the model to be
seen, then use <em>Model --> Invert Normals</em> to fix the issue.
</p>

<h2 id="4">Can the accuracy of face / landmark detection be improved?</h2>
<p>
The face / landmark detection algorithm is tuned to work best for children and young
adults and may not give good results for infants or much older people. The main difficulty
for infants is in ensuring that the 3D image captures the entirety of the head so that
registration has sufficient information about the surface geometry. The best way to see
how well mask registration is working is to toggle off the model
texture (press <em>T</em>) and any landmarks if visible (press <em>L</em>) and toggle
visualisation of the mapped mask on and off (press <em>M</em>).
Future versions of Cliniface will improve registration accuracy for infant's faces.
</p>

<h2 id="5">Can I still use 3D face models if they're poor quality?</h2>
<p>
Possibly. Cliniface comes with some tools to help clean up the facial geometry.
Some of this happens automatically when loading the model, but there are also
tools for smoothing and filling small holes. You can also manually
crop away unwanted parts of the model.
</p>

<h2 id="6">Is my face really that asymmetric?</h2>
<p>
The accuracy of asymmetry measurements depends upon the accuracy of facial registration
and alignment. Check the quality of registration by pressing <em>M</em> to toggle the
registered mask on and off after face / landmark detection. The registered
mask is aligned to the underlying template which has laterally symmetric pairs
of vertices. Alignment entails a Procrustes superimposition of the corresponding vertices
between the underlying symmetric template mask and the mask registered to the target face.
Asymmetry through the medial plane is due singularly to lateral differences in the
registered vertex pairs. The default asymmetry visualisation shows total asymmetry
through the medial plane in all three axes. Visualisations of asymmetry in only
certain axes can be accessed from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em> menu.
</p>

<h2 id="7">Can I use 3D models that don't have textures?</h2>
<p>
Yes. Face / landmark detection will still work and measurements are spatial so are not
affected. However, the models embedded in generated reports will lack a surface texture
and will be shown with a uniform blue texture so as to be distinct from the white background
of the report.
</p>

<h2 id="9">Why are some measurements missing growth curve data?</h2>
<p>
Cliniface uses growth curve data obtained from decades of research into facial anthropometrics.
These have typically been simple distance measurements obtained using rulers, tape measures,
or callipers; or angle measurements taken using protractors, or other specialist devices.
These measurements have largely been taken from participants of European / Caucasian descent.
Research is now being conducted on faces of people of different ethnicities using a wider range of
metric types - a lot of this work facilitated by 3D imaging systems and applications
like Cliniface that can help researchers and clinicians to record and generate
statistics for different demographic cohorts.
</p>
<p>
One of our aims is to include as much of this knowledge as possible within
Cliniface (growth curve data in particular) to make it easy for others to make use of
this work. However, finding and incorporating new data will take time. If you're aware
of some statistics about certain measurements for a particular demographic that you'd like
to see included in Cliniface, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to discuss its
inclusion. You might even be conducting research yourself involving the collection of
facial measurements. If so, Cliniface is a great way of making these data available
to others so let us know if we can help.
</p>

<h2 id="11">Why isn't the reporting function available?</h2>
<p>
Cliniface caches a copy of the model in U3D format before report generation is available.
For larger models, this can take some several seconds to complete before the report feature
is available. Note that the cached U3D model is regenerated every time the model geometry
is changed so try to minimise unneccessary updates to the model and ensure any
unwanted (non-facial) parts of the model are removed.
</p>
<p>
On Linux, it is possible that the version of <em>pdflatex</em> that Cliniface is set to use
does not understand the parameters being passed to it. You might not have the required LaTeX
packages to generate the report. Try running Cliniface from the command line and see what
error messages are displayed. Cliniface will first produce the scene.tex file in a temporary
directory. If you're keen to tinker, go to this directory and experiment with <em>pdflatex</em>
to see if LaTeX parses and generates the PDF okay outside of Cliniface. Errors due to missing
packages will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if on Windows, check if you have Cliniface installed correctly. Cliniface
should work okay installed as a regular program in the system's "Program Files"
folder, but there's a chance that users without administrator privileges will run
into permission issues. Try reinstalling Cliniface in the suggested default (home)
directory and try again.
</p>

<h2 id="12">Why can't I move the 3D model embedded in the generated PDF?</h2>
<p>
At time of writing, only Adobe's Acrobat Reader is widely known to be able to render
3D content within PDFs. Try opening the PDF using the latest version of that software
and make sure you enable 3D content for the document when asked. If you're not asked
it might be that this has been permanently disabled within Acrobat Reader's settings.
Note that you should always see the image in 2D in the PDF and if 3D content is enabled
you must click and drag the image to see it move.
</p>

<h2 id="13">Why is the interface blurry on my 4K screen?</h2>
<p>
Cliniface was not originally designed for high DPI monitors and so as a fix for Windows,
the actual display density is ignored resulting in slightly less sharp widgets but
with everything scaled correctly (everything would be too small otherwise).
This shouldn't affect your ability to use the software however.
</p>

<h2 id="13a">Is the legend displaying correctly in visualisations?</h2>
<p>
On some high DPI monitors under Windows, a bug in certain display drivers has been found
to cause the legend to show incorrect colour bands. Ensuring your graphics driver is up
to date should fix this issue.
</p>

<h2 id="13b">Why do I get an error about renaming files when trying to update?</h2>
<p>
This could be because you have Cliniface installed in a non-default location
that isn't within your home folder and so Windows isn't allowing the respective files
to be updated due to it not having the requisite permissions. Running Cliniface with
administrator privileges or reinstalling Cliniface in the recommended default location
should fix this issue.
</p>

<h2 id="14">Why is it juddery when moving the camera / model around?</h2>
<p>
You need a half decent graphics card, or a modern CPU with decent integrated graphics
(anything from three or four years ago should be okay). Also, check to ensure that
your machine is actually <em>using</em> your dedicated graphical processing unit (GPU)
for 3D rendering. If you're on Windows, it <em>should</em> detect that your GPU needs
to be rendering the graphics. On recent versions of Windows 10, you can manually
set Cliniface to run on the GPU by default when starting it (from Window's right
click menu). Also, for the best performance, make sure you're only rendering a single
model in a single viewer at a time. Graphics performance is also highly dependent on
the complexity of the model(s) being viewed (i.e., the number of graphical primitives
used to render the surface). On Linux, graphics drivers can be a bit hit and miss
but the same basic tips apply. See your distribution specific help on installing
hardware graphics drivers.
</p>

<h2 id="15">Does Cliniface work with photos / 2D images?</h2>
<p>
No, Cliniface only works with 3D facial images. There are some example 3D images
in Cliniface's installation direction (in the <em>examples</em> folder) if you want to play
around with what Cliniface can do. We are investigating options for leveraging 2D photos
in future versions of Cliniface so stay tuned.
</p>

<h2 id="16">Can I use Cliniface in my research?</h2>
<p>
Yes and we'd love you to! Cliniface was built to help both clinicians and researchers
so we're very happy to see it used in this way. Please remember to cite Cliniface properly
in your work - see <em>About</em> under the <em>Help</em> menu for more details.
</p>

<h2 id="17">Why can't Cliniface do X?</h2>
<p>
Maybe it should! <a href="contact.html">Let us know</a> how you think the feature might
work in Cliniface. If it's a good idea and it's aligned with our own vision then we may
try to include the feature in an upcoming release.
