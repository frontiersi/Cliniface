<center><h1>Importing &amp; Exporting Data</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
An image together with its metadata is saved by Cliniface in the 3DF file format.
The analysis and all other metadata can also be exported into human readable text formats,
or imported to overwrite an existing 3DF's metadata.
There are three different export file formats: XML, JSON, and CSV. Only the XML and JSON formats
can be used for importing data however.
The XML and JSON formats contain all information about the model and its assessments.
These formats use the same element tags as used in the 3DF file format itself.
These are described <a href="../fileformat.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The export only CSV format gives information about just the currently active assessment.
This is to allow users to easily import information gathered by Cliniface into spreadsheet
software or similar for follow up analysis. Upon saving the 3DF, the currently active
assessment is set as the default to allow for CSV export using the
<a href="cmdline.html">command line interface</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="importing_metadata">Importing metadata</h2>
<p>
To import data for the currently selected model, select <em>File --> Import Metadata</em> and browse to
the appropriate XML or JSON file. If the model has existing metadata, you will be warned about
overwriting the contents (for all assessments). Continue and the model's metadata
will be immediately updated. Save the newly updated 3DF to retain the changes.
</p>

<h2 id="exporting_metadata">Exporting metadata</h2>
<p>
To export data from the currently selected model, select <em>File --> Export Metadata</em> provide
a filename. The default filetype is CSV (for exporting only the currently active assessment)
but JSON and XML types can be selected from the filetype dropdown for exporting all metadata.
</p>

<h3 id="csv_format">The CSV export format</h3>
<p>
The data in the CSV file are laid out in five sections (described below).
Each section is comprised of one or more rows / lines.
</p>

<h4>Section 1: Subject / image summary</h4>
<p>
The first two lines in the CSV file give information about the subject / image.
There are 12 fields/columns in the first line ordered as: image reference, subject reference,
subject's sex, subject's date of birth, image capture date, subject's age at image capture,
subject's maternal ethnicity, subject's paternal ethnicity, study reference, image source,
assessor's name, and the assessor's notes.
The second line has four fields / columns saying how many lines / rows are in each of the remaining
four sections which in order record: landmarks, measurements, user measurements, and HPO terms.
</p>

<h4>Section 2: Landmarks</h4>
<p>
The second section records landmark positions - a single facial landmark per line (bilateral landmarks
are recorded over two lines). The fields per line are ordered as: the unique landmark identifier,
the landmark's name, the face lateral with respect to the subject ((L)eft, (R)ight, or (M)edial),
and the landmark's xyz position (three fields / columns).
</p>

<h4>Section 3: Measurements</h4>
<p>
The third section records measurements - one measurement per line.
The fields per line are ordered as: the unique measurement identifier, the measurement's name,
the face lateral with respect to the subject ((L)eft, (R)ight, or (M)edial), whether the measurement
was taken projected into one of the standard facial planes (<em>e.g.,</em> coronal or medial), the number
of dimensions (values) for the measurement, and the values themselves (one value per field / column).
</p>

<h4>Section 4: User measurements</h4>
<p>
The fourth section records user measurements - one per line.
The fields per line are ordered as: the measurement's unique ID (1 field), the measurement's name (1 field),
the xyz position of one red endpoint handle (3 fields), the xyz position of the other red endpoint handle (3 fields),
the xyz position of the orange handle (3 fields), the orientation vector (3 fields), the straight line distance
between the two endpoints (1 field), the surface distance between the endpoints (1 field), the depth (1 field),
the direct angle between the three handles (1 field), the angle projected into transverse plane (1 field),
the angle projected into sagittal plane (1 field), the angle projected into coronal plane (1 field),
and the cross sectional area (1 field). More information about taking user defined
measurements can be found <a href="callipers.html#_calliper_measurements">here</a>.
</p>

<h4>Section 5: Detected facial traits</h4>
<p>The final section gives information about the phenotypic traits (HPO terms) discovered (if any).
Each line gives the following ordered fields: the HPO term identifier, the trait's name,
the unique identifiers of the measurements related to the objective determination of this
trait (a comma delimited list of values in a <em>single</em> field / column), with the final four fields
being true / false values stating whether or not the statistics used in the criteria for determining
the presence of the atypical trait were a match for the subject's demographics.
The first of these values is true if and only if the subject's age was within the statistics of the
growth curve statistics used. The second value is true if and only if the subject's sex matched
the statistics used. The third and fourth values are true if and only if the subject's maternal
and paternal ethnicity (respectively) matched.
