<center><h1>Assessment Metadata</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>To perform a clinical assessment of the significance of the facial measurements, Cliniface needs
a few extra pieces of information regarding the subject. This information is entered via the
<em>Assessment Information</em> dialog which can be opened from the <em>File</em> menu, or is
automatically opened after face / landmark detection is initially performed. This dialog also
lists the facial traits that Cliniface has found to be of possible clinical significance, and
allows a different assessment to be created/selected in cases where multiple interpretations of
the facial surface are required. The image below shows the <em>Assessment Information</em>
dialog for Max immediately after landmark placement.

<h2 id="required_metadata">Entering subject information</h2>
<p>Subject demographic information must be entered to allow Cliniface to automatically identify
atypical facial traits. All required demographic data should be entered in the top left section
of the the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog above the thumbnail image.
</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Image Date</em>: The date the image was taken.</li>
<li><em>Birth Date</em>: The subject's date of birth.</li>
<li><em>Ethnicity (M)</em>: The subject's maternal ethnicity.</li>
<li><em>Ethnicity (P)</em>: The subject's paternal ethnicity.</li>
<li><em>Sex</em>: The subject's sex.</li>
</ul>

<p>The image date is initially set from the file creation time but this can be incorrect on
some platforms or if the file has been copied from elsewhere. It should be set to the date the
image was captured. Together with the date of birth, this is used by Cliniface to
know the subject's age at time of image capture.
</p>
<p>The ethnic group terms are taken from the
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1249.0">Australian Bureau of Statistics'
database of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG)</a>.
Ethnic groups are presented as a hierarchy. To explore subgroups, click the black arrows to the left
of the parent group to expand into submenus. For example, to find "Australian Aboriginal", click
the black arrow against "Oceanian", then again against "Australian Peoples" whereupon
"Australian Aboriginal" will be listed as a selectable ethnicity.
</p>
<p>The subject's sex can be left as <em>Female | Male</em> if unknown. Knowing the subject's sex
is important for some facial measurements which have distinctly different norms between the sexes
(<em>i.e.,</em> are sexually dimorphic).
</p>

<h3 id="other_metadata">Other assessment information</h3>
<p>Other (non-essential) information about the subject and image can be recorded in the top right
of the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog. These fields can be left blank but may be useful
to assist in looking up the image later on so should be entered if possible and relevant.
<ul>
<li><em>Image Source</em>: Either where the image was taken or the image capture device used.</li>
<li><em>Subject Ref</em>: A unique identifier for the subject of the image.</li>
<li><em>Image Ref</em>: A unique identifier for the image.</li>
<li><em>Study Ref</em>: A unique identifier for the study this image was acquired for.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="multiple_assessments">Multiple assessments</h3>
<p>Multiple assessments can be recorded against the 3D image. This can be useful in cases where different
users wish to record their own interpretations of the image. Each assessment has recorded against it a set
of landmark positions, a set of user measurements, and the contents of the notes field
directly below the assessment selection dropdown list. Only one assessment is active at one time for an
image and analysis <em>etc</em> is always performed with respect to the currently active assessment.
To select a different active assessment, select it from the dropdown list. If more than one assessment
is available for the image, the name of the currently active assessment is also shown in the application's
title bar next to the filepath of the image.
</p>

<p>The name of the default assessment is initially "Unknown". It is only neccessary to change this if
multiple assessments are being used and it should be changed to a unique value for the image (e.g.,
the name of the assessing clinician). The name can be changed by selecting and overtyping it.
To add a new assessment, use the button with the green plus symbol to the right of the <em>Assessment</em> field.
This will copy the existing landmarks and user measurements to a new assessment which can be renamed.
The contents of the notes field is set to record that these details were copied over from the source assessment.
Delete the current assessment using the button with the red cross. This deletes the assessment's
associated landmark positions, user measurements, and notes.
Different assessments store the landmark positions independently of one another. To overwrite the landmark
positions of all other assessments using the landmark positions from the currently active assessment,
use the button on the far right.
</p>

<p>The free text notes field should be used to record any salient observations.
These notes are output in some PDF reports (see below) and are not used in any automatic analysis.
Below this is a list of the HPO terms resulting from Cliniface's analysis. Each of these terms links out
to its corresponding page in the online Human Phenotype Ontology database (Internet connection required).
Cliniface updates its analysis whenever demographic information about the subject changes,
or when landmark positions change.
</p>

<h3 id="saving_changes">Saving changes</h3>
<p>Upon making changes to any of the assessment metadata, press <em>Apply</em> or <em>OK</em> to save and
effect the changes.
