<center><h1>Surface Visualisations</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Several different surface visualisations can be selected which replace the default photographic face
texture with information about the facial morphology. These visualisations may help to more effectively
evaluate the extent and severity of various facial traits, and - when two facial models
of the same individual are loaded - to gain an impression of changes in facial appearance.
</p>

<h2>Applying visualisations</h2>
<p>
The different surface visualisations can be applied by selecting them from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em>
menu. A selection of the more commonly used visualisations are also provided as toolbar buttons
(see image below). Visualisations can be toggled on and off by selecting and deselecting the corresponding
action or toolbar button. Clicking the texture / surface mapping button on the very left of the bottom toolbar
will also turn off the visualisation and reapply the default texture mapping.
Visualisations apply to all models in the same viewer. If the selected model
is copied to an adjacent viewer, a different visualisation can be applied to it there.
</p>
<p>
Surface visualisations map their respective scalar metrics to the model's surface at vertex positions
as different colours corresponding to different metric values. The vertex mapped values / colours
are interpolated across the model facets. A legend is shown for the active visualisation in the viewer
showing the association between the colours and the metric's values. The legend can be toggled off and
on using the <em>View --> Colour Mapping --> Scalar Legend</em> checkbox.
</p>
<p>
The visualisation mapping range of the metric and the number of colour bandings can be changed using
the value spinners in the centre of the bottom toolbar (shown below). For visualisations with both
positive and negative values, the mapping range is set as one number giving the symmetric range above
and below zero.

<h2>Available visualisations</h2>
<p>
Upon first loading a model and before face / landmark detection has been performed, only the curvature
visualisations can be selected. After performing face / landmark detection which registers the face to
the anthropometric mask, the asymmetry visualisations become available. Once a second model has been
loaded and after face / landmark detection has been performed on it, the shape difference
visualisations become available.
</p>

<h3>Curvature</h3>
<p>
Two different curvature visualisations are available: mean and absolute curvature. Both visualisations
map per vertex curvature values to the facial surface. These are calculated as combinations of the
first and second principal components of curvature using the area weighted mean of adjacent facet normals.
</p>

<h4>Mean curvature</h4>
<p>
The mean curvature visualisation shows regions of concavity and convexity in shades of blue and red
respectively - the deeper the colour, the more extreme the degree of curvature.
Per vertex values are calculated as the mean of the first and second principal
components of curvature. The default mapping range is set to +/- 45 degrees, but this can
be increased to 90 degrees. The default number of colour bands is 15.
</p>

<h4>Absolute curvature</h4>
<p>
Absolute curvature is similar to mean curvature but the direction of curvature is ignored. The
per vertex curvature value is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the first and
second principal components of curvature. The default mapping range is 0 to 45 degrees with
9 colour bands.
</p>

<h3>Asymmetry</h3>
<p>
Asymmetry visualisations for the selected model are available after face / landmark detection
has been performed. The calculation of asymmetry for visualisation purposes leverages the
registration of the anthropometric mask to the target (selected model) face. The template
mask is bilaterally symmetric and after registration the relative positions of symmetric
facet pairs can be compared to evaluate the degree of asymmetric deformation.
Deviation from perfect symmetry is mapped as the degree of extrusion and retrusion in
red and blue respectively. Visualisations are available for the magnitude of difference
with respect to the standard facial orientation, as well as difference in each of the
locally oriented face directions individually (<em>i.e.,</em> horizontally, vertically, and in depth).
</p>

<h3>Shape difference</h3>
<p>
Once two models have been loaded and face / landmark detection has been performed on
both, visualisations of differences in face shape become available. These visualisations
are described <a href="procrustes.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Associated reports</h2>
<p>
Certain visualisations have associated PDF reports which are available to generate when the visualisation
is active on the selected model. These reports use the current settings for the visualisation range and
number of colour bands when embedding their content in the report. More information about the
available reports can be found <a href="reports.html">here</a>. To generate a report for the active
visualisation, select its name from the report dialog when opened.
