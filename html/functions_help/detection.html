<center><h1>Face / Landmark Detection</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>To analyse a loaded 3D facial image, Cliniface takes measurements with respect to the
positions of a set of standard anthropometric landmarks and so it is important that they
are accurately placed. Cliniface finds the positions of these facial landmarks using a
method which iteratively deforms a template mask to fit the subject's 3D facial model.
Once fit, the standard set of landmarks are transferred to the target face whereupon the
user can manually fine-tune their positions.
</p>

<p>To detect the face and carry out landmark positioning, click <em>Detect Landmarks</em>
from the <em>Metrics</em> menu or click the corresponding toolbar button. After a few seconds
of processing Cliniface places landmarks on the face and resets the camera. At this point,
two new dialogs will appear: the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog which asks for metadata
about the subject in order to conduct the facial analysis, and the <em>Landmarks Browser</em> dialog
which while open allows the user to refine the positions of the landmarks.
</p>

<h2 id="moving_landmarks">Adjusting landmark positions</h2>
<p>The <em>Landmarks Browser</em> dialog gives descriptions of the correct placement of each of
the landmarks along with an example image of the desired placement. You should confirm that Cliniface
has correctly positioned each of the landmarks in accordance with this information or reposition
the landmarks by left clicking and dragging them to their new positions on the 3D model in the
main viewer. Moving the mouse cursor over the landmarks on the face in the main viewer changes the
description and the image shown in the <em>Landmarks Browser</em> so you are always looking
at the right information for the current landmark.
</p>

<p>Pay careful attention to how the landmarks are positioned from different viewpoints since
a landmark that appears correctly positioned from one viewpoint may in fact be incorrectly
positioned. In particular, pay special attention to the eye landmarks which can sometimes be
difficult to place due to the folds of the upper and lower eyelids.
</p>

<p>When you are happy with how the facial landmarks are placed, close the <em>Landmarks Browser</em>
to fix the landmarks from being accidentally moved in the course of normal camera / model interaction.
To adjust landmark positions again later, reopen the <em>Landmarks Browser</em> by selecting
<em>Edit Landmarks</em> from the <em>Metrics</em> menu. To restore a particular landmark to its
originally detected position, right click on it and select <em>Restore Landmark Position</em>
from the context menu. To restore <em>all</em> landmarks to their originally detected positions,
selected <em>Restore Detected Landmarks</em> from the <em>Metrics</em> menu.
</p>

<h2 id="landmark_visibility">Changing landmark visibility</h2>
<p>The yellow dots showing the positions of the landmarks can be toggled on and off by clicking
<em>Show Landmarks</em> from the <em>Metrics</em> menu, clicking the corresponding toolbar button,
or by pressing <em>L</em>. To change the visibility of individual landmarks, open the
<em>Landmarks Browser</em> by selecting <em>Edit Landmarks</em> from the <em>Metrics</em> menu,
and check/uncheck the boxes next to the landmarks whose visibility you want to toggle. Toggle
the visibility of all landmarks in the list by clicking the <em>eye</em> icon in the heading
of the list of landmarks.
</p>

<p>Note that whether or not the landmark points themeselves are currently
visible has no bearing Cliniface's ability to take the necessary facial measurements.
</p>

<h2 id="multiple_landmark_position_sets">Multiple landmark assessments</h2>
<p>It is possible for multiple sets of differently placed landmarks to be recorded against an
individual 3D image. While the positions of the landmarks ought to be objective, it is possible
that different assessors may disagree on the intepretation of one or more landmark positions.
For that reason, changes to the positions of the landmarks are recorded against only the
currently selected assessment of the 3D facial image. Upon changing the assessment, the
landmark positions are also changed to reflect the newly selected assessment record.
