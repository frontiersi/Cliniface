<center><h1>Model Changes</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Cliniface has some built-in tools to adjust the 3D model which can be useful to
fix some issues stemming from problematic image capture. These tools are in addition to the
cleaning operations undertaken automatically upon loading a 3D image which involve discarding
unused vertices and manifolds more than the specified maximum number per model (five by default).
</p>
<p>
Changes to the model are grouped under the <em>Transform</em> and <em>Model</em> menus. The actions
under the <em>Transform</em> menu relate to affine transformations, while actions under the
<em>Model</em> menu result in non-affine modifications to the model's underlying geometry.
</p>
<p>
Any changes to the model can be undone using the <em>File --> Undo</em> action.
</p>


<h2>Affine transformations</h2>
<p>
All of these actions which are available under the <em>Transform</em>
menu result in affine transforms of the selected model's geometry.
</p>

<h3 id="align">Align model</h3>
<p>
If face / landmark detection has been carried out on the selected model,
alignment restores the model to the standard position and orientation which is
in correspondence with the underlying template mask mapped to the face.
If face / landmark detection has not yet been carried out, an alignment
of the model is found which tries to orient the model into a front facing
upright orientation with the middle of the facial region centred at the origin.
If the model has no texture, the resulting alignment accuracy will be poor
until face / landmark detection has been performed.
</p>

<h3 id="centre">Centre model</h3>
<p>
Right clicking a point on the model surface and selecting this action translates the model
so that the selected point is at the world coordiates origin (0,0,0). If this action is selected
from the <em>Transform</em> menu (or the respective keyboard shortcut is used), the centre of
the model's bounding box is placed at 0,0,0. Save the model to fix the new position in place.
</p>

<h3 id="resize">Resize model</h3>
<p>
The resizing tool allows the model to be resized or rescaled in any or all dimensions.
This tool is especially useful if the model has been encoded in units other than
millimetres. Upon selecting this tool, the dialog below is displayed:
</p>

<p>
To rescale the model, enter new scale value(s) in the Scale column. Click the lock buttons
to unlocki / lock the dimension. With a dimension unlocked, different scale values can
be set for that dimension otherwise all locked dimensions will reflect the same change
in scale. Note that adjusting the size value directly for any dimension if locked will
enforce the proportional change in size for other locked dimensions. Press <em>OK</em>
when finished changing the values to effect the transformation.
</p>

<h3 id="reflect">Reflect model</h3>
<p>
This action reflects the model through the medial plane if face / landmark detection has
been performed, otherwise reflection is with respect to the saved orientation of the model
about its local YZ plane which slices through the middle of the model's bounding box.
</p>

<h3 id="rotate">Rotate 90 degrees about X/Y/Z</h3>
<p>
These three actions rotate the model through a 90 degree angle in the respective axis
which is defined with respect to the model's local orientation.
</p>

<h3 id="manually_align">Manually reposition</h3>
<p>
Select this action to enter manual model alignment interaction mode which allows
the model's position and orientation with respect to the world coordinate system
to be adjusted interactively using the mouse. This action is toggled off if a
mouse button is clicked with the cursor off the model and mouse use reverts to
camera interaction mode. See <a href="camera.html#moving_model">here</a> for
more information about manual repositioning.
</p>

<h2>Model modifications</h2>
<h3 id="invert_normals">Invert normals</h3>
<p>
The normal direction of each facet (triangle) in the model is defined by the
storage order of facet vertices. This defines the model's outward facing surface
onto which the facial texture is applied. Some modelling / capture systems
generate models with triangle vertices stored in an incorrect
(non-standard) order. This can result in the outward face being projected inward and
the texture (if present) not being displayed correctly. If this issue is suspected,
select this action to reverse the storage order of the vertices for each triangle on the model.
Selecting the action again restores the previous per facet vertex ordering.
</p>

<h3 id="fill_holes">Fill holes</h3>
<p>
Select this option to fill holes in the model's geometry. A model is comprised of
one or more separate manifolds - each manifold being a connected collection of facets.
A manifold has holes if it has more than one boundary where boundary edges are defined
as facet edges that are unshared with any other facets. The number of boundaries
per manifold can be seen in the <em>Model Properties</em> dialog accessible from
the <em>File</em> menu (see <a href="fileio.html">here</a> for more details).
</p>
<p>
Any holes are filled coarsely with only a minimal number of new vertices and facets
added in order to recover a contiguous surface which may not necessarily reflect
the local curvature of the manifold.
For this reason, hole filling should be used only to fill small holes in the
model (one or two facet sized regions) and not used to reconstruct large
sections of the model. In such cases, it is more appropriate to reimage the
subject.
</p>

<h3 id="smooth">Smooth surface</h3>
<p>
Surface smoothing minimises the severity of local curvature by adjusting the positions
of vertices to positions that are means of their local neighbours for vertices with
sufficiently high curvature factors. The intention is to remove "spikes" and "ridges"
which may cause inaccuracies in face / landmark detection. Depending on the model
capture / generation technique used, these "noisy" areas of geometry may be present
if the subject's face was wet or excessively reflective at time of capture.
</p>
<p>Surface smoothing should be performed prior to face / landmark detection 
to maximise automatic face / landmark detection mapping accuracy.
The severity of surface geometry noise can be explored using the
curvature visualisations accessible from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em> menu.
</p>

<h3 id="extract_face">Extract facial region</h3>
<p>
Selecting this action will discard those parts of the model that Cliniface believes
are not part of the face. This may be performed prior to face / landmark detection
but its accuracy may be poor if the model is untextured. If this action is carried
out after face / landmark detection, the extracted facial region is defined by the
outermost extents of the landmarks.
</p>
<p>
Note that it is <em>not</em> usually necessary to perform this action to improve
face / landmark detection (mask registration) since the facial registration area
is automatically restricted to the discovered facial region. However, in cases
where the model is untextured, automatic extraction of the facial region may
give poor results until face / landmark detection has been carried out.
</p>

<h3 id="create_symmetric_face">Create right / left symmetric face</h3>
<p>
This action takes the respective side of the subject's face and mirrors it
laterally (through the medial plane) to replace the other side resulting
in a perfectly symmetric face. This can be useful in a comparative analysis
of facial asymmetry though it is usually preferable to use the standard
asymmetry visualisations accessible from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em> menu.
</p>
<p>If face / landmark detection has not yet been performed, reflection
of the face side will be carried out through the local YZ slicing place with
respect to the model's bounding box. Needless to say, this can lead to unusual
results if the face is not centred within the bounding box.
