<center><h1>Camera &amp; Model Interaction</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>
Changing the camera view or the model's position and orientation in the scene is carried out
with the mouse. By default (and after most actions), the interaction mode is set to
camera control where the mouse controls the position, orientation, and focus of the camera.
In the model interaction mode, the mouse controls the position and orientation of the model.
In normal circumstances, it is never necessary to enter model control mode since model
alignment is automatically handled as a result of face / landmark detection.
</p>

<h2 id="moving_camera">Adjusting the camera</h2>
<p>
Upon initially loading a model, the camera's position is placed infront of the model
and is focused ot the origin. If the model was not centred at the time of capture this will
mean that the face is not centred in the viewer. After detecting the face and landmarks,
the model will be recentred (see <a href="detection.html">detecting the face</a>).
</p>
<p>
The camera can be rotated around the current focus by left clicking and dragging the mouse.
Right-clicking and dragging pans the camera (note that this changes the point of focus).
Using the mouse wheel or clicking the middle mouse button and dragging zooms by changing
the distance of the camera from the model.
If you only have a one or two button mouse, hold <em>SHIFT</em> while left-clicking and dragging
to pan the camera, or <em>CTRL</em> while clicking and dragging to zoom.
</p>
<p>
To set the focus on a different part of the model, simply left double-click on that part.
Alternatively, right-click on the model's surface and select <em>Set Camera Focus</em>
from the context menu or press <em>F</em> with the mouse cursor pointing at the part you
want to refocus upon.
</p>

<h3 id="fixed_camera_views">Standard camera views</h3>
<p>
Standard camera orientations can be selected from the toolbar and from the <em>Camera</em> menu.
While the toolbar provides buttons for right, left, and front profile views, more are available via
the menu. In addition, the cursor keys can be used as shortcuts to set the camera to one of the
available standard views. Press the <em>spacebar</em> to return to the front view.
Incremental (5 degree) changes in camera orientation can also be effected by holding
<em>CTRL</em> and pressing any of the cursor keys. Changes in the camera's position, orientation,
and focus are shown in the status bar.
</p>

<p>
Pressing any of the standard camera view buttons (including the <em>spacebar</em> to return to
front view) acts in three stages. Upon the first press of the view button, the orientation is
set while the current camera distance and focus are maintained. Upon the second press, the camera
distance is reset to allow the whole model to be viewed. Finally, upon the third press, the camera
focus is set to the origin. This behaviour is especially useful when adjusting facial landmarks
or when placing user defined measurements.
</p>

<h3 id="camera_projection">Camera projection mode</h3>
<p>
The camera is set to perspective projection mode by default but can be set to orthographic
projection by toggling <em>Orthographic Projection</em> in the <em>Camera</em> menu or by
toggling on the respective toolbar button. Note that when the measurements browser is opened,
orthographic projection mode is automatically turn on (and turned off again when the measurements
browser is closed). This behaviour can be changed from the <a href="../preferences.html">preferences</a>
dialog. The default field of view in perspective projection mode is 30&deg; and this can also
be changed in preferences.
</p>

<h3 id="camera_synch">Camera synchronisation</h3>
<p>
Loading a second model places it into a separate viewer. By default, camera movements between the
viewers are synchronised meaning that moving the camera in one viewer moves the other viewer's
camera in the same way. This behaviour can be disabled / enabled by toggling
<em>Camera --> Synchronise Cameras</em> or the corresponding toolbar button.
</p>

<h2 id="moving_model">Transforming the model</h2>
<p>In normal use it is not usually necessary to adjust the position of the model because Cliniface's
face detection algorithm acts on an internally aligned version if the face cannot be immediately
detected in the model's current orientation. However, if the model is untextured, or the user simply
wishes to reorient and save the model for later processing, model interaction mode can be useful.
</p>

<p>To reposition the model, first enter model interaction mode by selecting <em>Manually Reposition</em>
from the <em>Transform</em> menu, clicking the corresponding toolbar button, or pressing <em>Z</em>.
Clicking and dragging on the model then causes it to move around independently of the camera.
Left-clicking and dragging rotates the model about its centre, right-clicking and dragging
translates it laterally, and the mouse wheel moves it backwards and forwards. Clicking off
the model (or toggling off the icon) will revert to camera interaction mode.
</p>

<h3 id="swapping_viewers">Copying and moving models between viewers</h3>
<p>Up to two models can be simultaneously loaded. By default these are shown in separate viewers.
If two models are loaded, the selected one can be moved into an adjacent viewer using the block arrow
buttons left and right of the dropdown list under the viewer. The buttons with plus symbols make a copy
of the selected model and place it in the corresponding adjacent viewer. This can be useful for
viewing two different visualisations on the same model at once. Note that changes to the underlying
model are reflected in both views of the model. Use the move button to merge a view of a model
back with its copy.
</p>

<h3 id="model_alignment">Automatic model alignment</h3>
<p>To align the model automatically, click the gyroscope button in the toolbar, select
<em>Align Model</em> from the <em>Transform</em> menu, or press <em>SHIFT + spacebar</em>.
If face / landmark detection has been carried out, this will return the model into standard
facial alignment. If face / landmark detection has not been carried out, this will perform
a coarse alignment based on a simpler face and geometry detection algorithm.
