<center><h1>Generating Reports</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
PDF report generation is available if <em>pdflatex</em> is installed which is part of a standard
LaTeX distribution. LaTeX is a document typesetting language and preparation system and it
is used by Cliniface to generate its reports. On Linux, LaTeX is usually easily installed
via the package management system used by your distribution of Linux. On Windows, a minimal
LaTeX distribution is provided with the Cliniface installer that includes all the packages
necessary to generate Cliniface's reports. More information about LaTeX is available at
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">https://www.latex-project.org/</a>.
</p>

<h2>Generating a report</h2>
<p>
To generate a report, click <em>File --> Generate Report</em> or the corresponding toolbar button.
From the dialog, select the desired report name from the dropdown list and press <em>OK</em>.
After some moments, you will be asked where to save the report. Once saved, the
report will open in your default PDF viewer (if enabled in <a href="../preferences.html">preferences</a>).
</p>

<h2>Available reports</h2>
<p>
After loading a 3D image and assuming LaTeX was found, reporting options will become
available. Reports are generated for the currently selected model and model assessment.
The generated reports include manipulable 3D face(s). At the time of writing, only
Adobe's Acrobat Reader is known to be capable of displaying the 3D content within
the PDFs - other PDF viewers will simply show a static 2D image of the subject's face.
If using Acrobat Reader, in order to view 3D content you may be asked to enable
this functionality upon opening the PDF.
</p>
<p>
The number and type of reports available depends upon whether face / landmark detection
has been carried out, and what visualisation (if any) is active. Initially, before
face / landmark detection has been performed, only a basic report is available which
simply embeds the model as a 3D object inside a PDF. After face / landmark detection
has been performed, more reporting options are made available. These standard
report types are described below.
</p>

<h3>Model Only</h3>
<p>
Simply includes the fully manipulable model embedded inside the generated PDF
with report date and Cliniface logo in the header.
</p>

<h3>Noted Phenotypic Traits</h3>
<p>
As well as a 3D embedded model of the subject's face, this report includes subject / image
metadata (as entered in the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog) and notes from
the active assessment. Below the embedded model are the phenotypic traits that
Cliniface has found from its analysis of the placement of the landmarks together
with the provided subject demographic information. These are shown as HPO term
hyperlinks out to the online HPO database.
</p>


<h3>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)</h3>
<p>
A report specifically detailing measurements about the sentinel facial features of FASD.
The report is formatted as two columns. In addition to the information present in
the <em>Noted Phenotypic Traits</em> report, the right column of the report contains
information specific to the FASD facial features and summarises the contents of the
FASD dialog (accessible via the <em>Metrics</em> menu).
</p>

<h3>Asymmetry Visualisation Reports</h3>
<p>
Colour mapped asymmetry visualisations of the selected model are available with any
of the respective asymmetry visualisations active (accessed from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em>
menu). These reports show two embedded 3D models of the selected subject - the left image
being the standard textured face for comparison against its colour mapped variant in
the right column with colour legend corresponding to the currently selected values
in Cliniface's main viewer. Due to limitations in how the embedded 3D model in the PDF
is rendered and lit, it may be difficult to ascertain the facial shape in the colour
mapped version without changing the rendering mode of the model within Adobe Acrobat Reader.
</p>

<h3>Phenotypic Facial Comparison</h3>
<p>
After loading a second model and carrying out face / landmark detection on both
models, this report becomes available. This report contains information about
both the loaded models in two separate columns with subject / image metadata
shown for each along with each image's list of noted phenotypic traits.
The selected model is always in the left column.
</p>

<h3>Shape Differences Visualisation Reports</h3>
<p>
These reports are similar to the <em>Asymmetry Visualisation Reports</em> but for
the <em>Shape Difference</em> visualisations accessible from the <em>View --> Colour Mapping</em>
menu.
The three different shape difference report types are for total difference,
perpendicular difference, and tangential difference.
These reports are available with the corresponding visualisation active. Note that these
visualisations can only be activated if a second model is loaded and face / landmark
detection has been performed on both.
