<center><h1>Loading and Saving</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Cliniface can load 3D images saved in a variety of different file formats. Alongside their own
(often proprietary) file formats, most 3D capture systems can export to more commonly used
industry standard formats such as Wavefront OBJ which Cliniface can read in.
</p>
<p>While Cliniface doesn't require 3D facial images to be textured, for best performance models
should have texture information saved against them since 2D texture based face detection is used
to intially align and place landmarks on the face. In addition, when capturing subjects
in 3D, measurement units should be set to millimetres which is Cliniface's unit of measurement. This
will ensure that when loaded into Cliniface, facial measurements taken from the model are immediately
comparable against Cliniface's internal database of standard facial measurements.
Models saved in units other than millimetres can be scaled up or down by the requisite
factor using Cliniface's built-in <a href="model_tools.html#resizing">resizing tool</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="loading">Loading a 3D facial image</h2>
<p>Load a model by either dragging the file to the application window, or by selecting <em>Open</em>
from the <em>File</em> menu (or by clicking the corresponding toolbar button) and selecting the file
to load from the dialog. By default, Cliniface only loads the five largest manifolds in the saved file.
A manifold is a set of vertices (points) connected by facets (triangles). A pair of facets is considered
to be part of the same manifold if they have at least one vertex in common. The number of manifolds to
load per image can be set differently from the <a href="../preferences.html">preferences</a> dialog.
</p>

<p>Cliniface's own 3D file format uses the 3df extension. This format is a compressed achive containing
geometry and texture information stored in Wavefront OBJ format alongside XML metadata. As well as
the 3DF format, images stored in any of the following 3D file formats can be loaded:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>AC3D (ac, ac3d, acc)</li>
    <li>ASE (ase, ask)</li>
    <li>Autodesk (fbx)</li>
    <li>Blender (blend)</li>
    <li>BlitzBasic (b3d)</li>
    <li>Collada (dae)</li>
    <li>Drawing Interchange Format (dxf)</li>
    <li>Extensible 3D (x3d)</li>
    <li>Industry Foundation Classes (ifc, ifczip)</li>
    <li>LightWave (lws, mot, lwo, lxo)</li>
    <li>Milkshape (ms3d)</li>
    <li>Nendo (ndo)</li>
    <li>Neutral (enff, nff)</li>
    <li>OFF (off)</li>
    <li>Polygon File Format (ply)</li>
    <li>Quick3D (q3o, q3s)</li>
    <li>Raw (raw)</li>
    <li>Silo (sib)</li>
    <li>StepFile (stp)</li>
    <li>Stereolithography (stl)</li>
    <li>Terragen Heightmap (ter)</li>
    <li>Valve SMD (smd, vta)</li>
    <li>Wavefront OBJ (obj)</li>
    <li>XGL (xgl, zgl)</li>
</ul>

<p>A second model can be loaded in addition to the first with the second being displayed in a separate
viewer. After face and landmark detection has been performed on both models, Cliniface can
<a href="procrustes.html">compare differences in facial shape between the pair</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="model_properties">Model properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Model Properties</em> dialog shown below can be accessed from the <em>File</em> menu.
This summarises the geometry of the selected model and allows individual manifolds to be removed.
The selected manifold can be removed using the button on the bottom left of the dialog, and all
manifolds <em>except</em> the selected one can be removed by using the button to the right of this.
Select a different manifold using the dropdown. The number of polygons (facets), vertices, and
boundaries of the selected manifold is shown alongside the total number of each for the model.
The spatial extents of the currently selected manifold are shown on the right. With this dialog
open, the boundaries of the selected manifold are outlined on the model in the main viewer.
</p>

<h2 id="saving">Saving the image and analysis</h2>
<p>Save the selected model by choosing <em>Save As</em> from the <em>File</em> menu or
selecting <em>Save</em> to overwrite the existing saved file. Alternatively, press the
corresponding toolbar button or press <em>CTRL + S</em>. The default file format for
saving to is Cliniface's 3DF file format which stores the model and texture
information along with all metadata entered using Cliniface. The other file formats
that can be saved to are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stereolithography (stl)</li>
    <li>Polygon File Format (ply)</li>
    <li>Universal 3D (u3d)</li>
    <li>Wavefront OBJ (obj)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that none of these other file formats are able to save metadata entered into Cliniface
and only the U3D and OBJ file formats can save texture information about the model. The model
is always saved in its current position and orientation. If face / landmark detection was
carried out and the model was saved in 3DF format, upon loading next time it will be
automatically aligned according to these data.
</p>

<h2 id="closing">Closing model(s)</h2>
<p>To close the selected model, select <em>Close</em> from the <em>File</em> menu, or
select <em>Close All</em> to close both of the loaded models. If the model has not been
saved upon the request to close it, a warning is presented and an option to cancel provided.
