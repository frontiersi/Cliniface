<p>
Cliniface takes measurements based on the positions of standard landmarks. These measurements
are compared against known statistics of facial growth available from the research literature. This
section describes how the various facial measurements are taken and then how they are analysed to
infer the presence of atypical facial traits.

<h2 id="_metric_types">Measurement types</h2>
<p>
Cliniface takes five different kinds of measurement which are calculated from the spatial positions
of the facial landmarks (or weighted combinations of the landmark positions).
Each metric type is described below in turn.
</p>

<h3 id="_angle">Angle</h3>
<p>
Angle measurements are always taken parallel to one of the canonical anatomical facial planes.
They are defined by three points: two outer points and an inner point at which the angle is
measured as the arc subtended by the two line segments that meet at the inner point and with
end-points at the outer points. The angle is single dimensioned and is shown in degrees.
</p>

<h3 id="_asymmetry">Asymmetry</h3>
<p>
Asymmetry is measured as signed distance in the X, Y, and Z axes representing asymmetry through
the medial, transverse, and coronal planes respectively, and as overall magnitude (four dimensional).
For a bi-lateral landmark pair {p,q} with p on the right lateral and q on the left, calculation is as
follows: p is reflected through the medial plane to point p'. Difference vector d = q - p' is taken,
the components of which correspond to asymmetry along the respective axes. Magnitude is as the
L2 norm of d. Because the values corresponding to the axial components are signed, positive values
denote outgrowth in the positive halfspace (or ingrowth in the negative halfspace) through the respective plane.
</p>

<h3 id="_depth">Depth</h3>
<p>
The dimension of depth measurements is not fixed. A depth measurement is taken from a point in space
above the surface of the face to the surface of the face. The direction in which depth is measured
depends upon the measurement but can be in-plane (parallel with an anatomical facial plane) in which
case the measurement is marked "[IN-PLANE]" in the bottom left of the main viewer or at right angles
to a line segment defined between two points. See <a href="#_in-plane">here</a> for more information
about in-plane measurements.
</p>

<h3 id="_distance">Distance</h3>
<p>
Distance measurements are one dimensional straight-line distances between pairs of landmarks
(or weighted combinations of landmarks).
</p>

<h3 id="_region">Region</h3>
<p>
Region measurements are one dimensional and are a measure of the ratio of the square of a
region's perimeter with its area. Currently, the sole measurement of this kind in Cliniface
is <em>Upper Lip Circularity</em>.
</p>


<h2 id="_analysis">Automated facial analysis</h2>
<p>
The different measurements described above are automatically taken from the 3D facial image
whenever the positions of related landmarks on the face change. Every time this happens or the
subject's demographic information changes, Cliniface updates its analysis by comparing the
measurements to statistics matched to the subject. These results are then forwarded through
to an objective criteria checking scheme for predefined facial traits of clinical significance.
If the criteria conditions are met for any of these traits then they are automatically flagged
as being present for the selected subject.
</p>

<h3 id="_measurements_browser">Measurements browser</h3>
<p>
After performing face / landmark detection, the <em>Measurements Browser</em> (shown below)
can be accessed from the <em>Metrics</em> menu.
</p>
<center><img src="../images/measurements_browser.png"/></center>

<p>
Upon its opening, the measurements are also visualised graphically in the main viewer
on the loaded faces. Highlight a metric by clicking its row in the table or using the up
and down arrow keys. This highlights the measurement on the faces and updates the
text in the bottom of the viewers to show that measurement's values for the respective faces
(note that if two faces are in a single viewer then no measurement data is shown).
</p>
<p>
Some measurements are multi-dimensional (e.g., asymmetry) with the values for each dimension shown
from left to right in the row marked "Measure". Measurements with associated growth curve data show the
corresponding Z-scores underneath. Not all measurements have growth curve data, and many measurements
have growth curve data only for people of European ethnic descent. Any mismatches in
demographic data with the available measurement statistics are shown alongside the measurement values.
</p>
<p>
The table of measurements can be filtered by measurement type, anatomical region, and related HPO term
(filtering by related syndrome is disabled in the current version).
</p>

<h3 id="_stats-match">Automatic statistics matching</h3>
<p>
Cliniface tries to automatically match the demographics of the facial image to growth curve statistics
from the those available for each measurement. The closest match is used if an exact match isn't found,
and this may result in there being a demographic mismatch for the selected measurement and subject.
If this is the case, the nature of the mismatch is shown in the bottom left of the main viewer alongside
the measurement values.
</p>

<p>
To disable automatic statistics matching, uncheck the <em>Subject Match</em> checkbox in the measurements
browser. This enables manual selection of statistics for the currently selected measurement using the
dropdown lists for sex, ethnicity, and source (where more than one source of growth curve data is
available for the selected sex / ethnicity combination). Checking the <em>Subject Match</em> checkbox
resets the chosen statistics for that measurement. <em>Note that leaving this checkbox unchecked for
any measurement will prevent Cliniface from automatically selecting the most appropriate set
of growth curve statistics for the currently selected face!</em> For this reason it is usually best
to recheck this box after exploring the available statistics for a given measurement.
</p>

<h3 id="_charts">Growth curve charts</h3>
<p>
Click the graph button in the bottom right of the <em>Measurements Browser</em> to see a graph of the growth
curve statistics for the highlighted measurement. The graph shows the growth curve distribution of that
measurement for the current source of data. The markers on the graph show the subject's measurement as
a round coloured dot (or dots for bilateral measurements). Hollow dot(s) indicate that the subject
is outside the age domain of the growth curve.
</p>
<p>
The graph shows the mean of the measurement and +/- 1 and 2 standard deviations by age.
If the measurement is multi-valued, select which value dimension to view from the dropdown list on
the bottom left of the chart dialog. The chart can be saved as an image by clicking the
adjacent save button. The image below shows the chart dialog with Cliniface's Australian Aboriginal
statistics for the measurement of <em>Nasal Protrusion</em>.
</p>

<h3 id="_in-plane">In-plane measurements</h3>
<p>
Different sources of the statistics used in Cliniface have used different methods to take the same
measurements. For example, most inter-landmark distances are measured as the length of the straight
line segment between the respective landmark point pairs.
However, the standard clinical protocol for measuring some inter-landmark distances
requires measuring the length of the <em>projection</em> of the connecting line segment into one of
the standard facial planes. In Cliniface, this is termed an <em>in-plane</em> measurement. Some types
of measurement such as angles are always taken <em>in-plane</em>.
</p>
<p>
In-plane measurements are also a potential source of error: if the ends of a manual
measurement device (<em>e.g.,</em> a ruler) are not held close to and equidistantly from the face,
this will result in the reported distance being shorter than in actuality. Therefore it is important
that all measurement statistics used in Cliniface are clear about how they have been obtained.
Cliniface uses only statistics where the measuring protocol has been clearly explained in the
associated published literature.
</p>

<p>
The growth curve statistics for a given measurement specify whether they have
been generated from <em>in-plane</em> measurements or not. Cliniface takes
in-plane measurements if the matched set of statistics is itself derived from
in-plane measurements and will switch measurement mode automatically to match
set set source of statistics.
</p>

<p>
In the example below, the automatically matched statistics for <em>Nasal Height</em> are from
the <a href="https://facebase.org">FaceBase</a> website which provides statistics for this
measurement as a point-to-point distance between the subnasale and nasion landmarks.
</p>

<center><img src="../images/nasal_height_1.png"/></center>

<p>
In the image below, having manually changed the measurement statistics to a set generated
from in-plane measurements, Cliniface shows the measurement taken in the corresponding
fashion with the distance projected into the coronal plane. This foreshortens the distance
appropriately to match the statistics being compared against.
</p>

<center><img src="../images/nasal_height_2.png"/></center>

<p>
If the measurement is taken in-plane due to the selected statistics the flag "[IN-PLANE]" is displayed
next to the measurement values. To override Cliniface from automatically matching the mode in which
the measurement is taken to the selected statistics, check / uncheck the <em>In-plane</em> checkbox
in the <em>Measurements Browser</em>. This can only be changed if the <em>Subject Match</em> checkbox
is unchecked since manually setting the statistics to compare against is not usually appropriate
since there's a risk of mismatching the subject's demographics.
If the mode of measurement (in or out of plane) does not match the mode used by the selected
statistics, the flag "[IN-PLANE MISMATCH]" is displayed next to the measurement values.
</p>

<h3 id="_atypical">Atypical features</h3>
<p>
Depressing the large warning triangle button in the bottom right of the <em>Measurements Browser</em>
restricts the visible set of measurements to only those that are related to facial traits that
are found to be atypical according to their objective criteria given the currently set statistics.
</p>
<p>
Depressing this button also restricts the terms listed in the <em>Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
Browser</em> to those that fulfill the criteria for being found on the subject's face.
This list of HPO terms is also updated in the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog (see <a href="metadata.html">here</a> for details).
</p>


<h3 id="_hpo_browser">Human Phenotype Ontology browser</h3>
<p>
The <em>Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Browser</em> (shown below) can be accessed from the <em>Metrics</em> menu.
This shows the table of HPO terms that Cliniface has objective criteria for and can detect <em>in principle</em>.
</p>

<center><img src="../images/hpo_browser.png"/></center>

<p>
HPO terms can be filtered by anatomical region. The main table shows each term on its own row with
the currently selected term highlighted. Click a different row or use the up and down arrow keys
to show information related to each term. The columns from left to right respectively give the official
identifier, the name of the term, and the related measurements. Beneath the table are remarks about
the selected term including any synonyms plus any references. Below the synonyms is a link to the
online website where details about the term and its related syndromes and genes can be found.
</p>
<p>
To the right of this is given the objective and the subjective identifying criteria for the selected trait.
The objective criteria is what Cliniface uses to classify the presence of the trait and this describes the
measurement(s) used to discover whether or not the trait is present. Underneath this are the subjective
criteria which describe the observations that a clinician might typically use to determine if the
trait is present or not.
