<center><h1>Preferences</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Cliniface's preferences dialog (shown below) is accessed from the <em>Help</em> menu.
Settings are saved between sessions in the <em>.cliniface</em> directory in your user directory.
Clicking the <em>Reset</em> button resets the values to their defaults.

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
General options control how Cliniface behaves and displays content.
</p>

<h3>Automatically check for updates at startup</h3>
<p>
When Cliniface starts it checks if an update is available and offers to download and install it if
available. Uncheck this box to prevent Cliniface from automatically checking. You can still
manually check for updates by selecting <em>Help --> Check for updates</em>.
</p>

<h3>Load example images into database at startup</h3>
<p>
The example images provided with Cliniface are loaded at startup into the database and are shown in the Image Browser.
To prevent the example images from being loaded at startup, uncheck this box. Note that if an existing database
already contains the example images, it will need to be reset to remove the example images.
</p>

<h3>Display model bounding boxes</h3>
<p>
A wireframe box is placed around the currently selected model. Uncheck this to
turn it off. Note that the name of the selected model is shown in Cliniface's titlebar.
</p>

<h3>Turn on parallel projection when viewing metrics</h3>
<p>
Checked by default, the camera projection is set to orthographic mode
when viewing measurements to help accurately compare angles and distances
without distortion.
</p>

<h3>Use white rendering background</h3>
<p>
By default this is checked but some visualisations or environments
can benefit from having a black background (unchecked).
</p>

<h3>Open generated reports in default PDF viewer</h3>
<p>
Cliniface can automatically open generated reports with your system's default PDF viewer.
On Windows, users should use Adobe Acrobat Reader since this supports viewing and interacting
with the 3D models that Cliniface embeds into its reports. Acrobat Reader for Windows can be
downloaded from <a href="https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader">https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader</a>.
Adobe stopped supporting Acrobat Reader for Linux in May 2013, however as of this writing
it is still possible to obtain a version from
<a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/9.x/9.5.5/enu">ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/9.x/9.5.5/enu</a>.
</p>

<h3>Enable FXAA anti-aliasing</h3>
<p>
Checked by default, this option will reduce the appearance of jagged lines in the viewer due to sharp pixel edges.
</p>

<h3>Use Phong shading for surface illumination</h3>
<p>
Checked by default, this interpolates lighting for more realistic shading across mesh triangle boundaries.
</p>

<h3>Interpolate surface mapped scalar values</h3>
<p>
Checked by default, this allows for boundary shading within mesh triangles.
Leave on for more accurate scalar visualisations.
</p>

<h3>Camera view angle</h3>
<p>
Changes the camera field of view (30 degrees by default).
The field of view is ignored when parallel projection is on.
</p>

<h3>Automatic facial cropping radius</h3>
<p>
The radius of the facial region used for automatic cropping <em>when landmarks are NOT defined</em>.
</p>

<h3>Maximum manifolds per model</h3>
<p>
3D models can consist of several manifold surfaces that may or may not be connected to one another.
Ideally, each model should be comprised of a single (connected) manifold that can be deformed into a flat
2D sheet. There should be no "overlapping layers", or segments that are disconnected from the main surface.
Cliniface processes the model geometry upon loading to segment out the separate manifolds, but it only
includes in the finally loaded model the N largest manifold surfaces. This is done to avoid loading in
many disconnected triangles from poorly generated or overly complex models that may degrade processing.
By default, N is set to five.
</p>

<h2>Program / File Config (changes require restart)</h2>
<p>
Changes to the following options are not applied until Cliniface restarts.
</p>

<h3>pdflatex</h3>
<p>
Cliniface generates reports using LaTeX. If the <em>pdflatex</em> program is not available, report generation is
disabled. On Windows, this is automatically set to the version of <em>pdflatex</em> supplied with Cliniface.
On Linux, by default Cliniface looks for <em>pdflatex</em> in the system directory <em>/usr/bin</em>.
To use a different version of <em>pdflatex</em>, you must ensure that your LaTeX installation has the
required packages.
</p>

<h3>InkScape</h3>
<p>
Cliniface can leverage <em>InkScape</em> to produce graphs in its reports that use vector graphics instead
of pixel based images. This allows for consistent fonts across the report. If <em>InkScape</em> is not available,
Cliniface embeds raster images in its reports. Cliniface looks for <em>InkScape</em> automatically when first run,
but this setting can be changed later. On Windows, Cliniface may not be able to use the Windows Store version
of <em>InkScape</em> - you should download and install the version available from the official
<a href="https://inkscape.org">website</a>.
