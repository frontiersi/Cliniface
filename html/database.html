<center><h1>Image Browser</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Cliniface's database of images can be accesed from the <em>File</em> menu by selecting
<em>Image Browser</em> or by pressing the <em>TAB</em> key.
At startup, the existing image database is loaded which contains the paths to any 3DF
files opened in Cliniface during the last session (as well as any 3DF files discovered
after resetting the database (see below).
A thumbnail image of the subject from the selected row is shown in the bottom
right of the dialog, and double clicking a row loads that file.

<h2>Resetting the database</h2>
<p>
Click <em>Reset Database</em> to clear the existing database and recursively search for 3DF files
within a selected directory. Upon selecting a directory, metadata from each discovered 3DF file
is parsed and loaded into the database. Note that this may take a while if the selected directory
contains a very large number of 3DF files, or if the directory is on a network shared drive.
</p>
<p>
By default, the example 3DF images that are supplied with Cliniface
are loaded into the database at startup. This can be prevented by deselecting the relevant option
in Cliniface's preferences dialog.
</p>

<h2>Searching the image database</h2>
<p>
The bottom section of the dialog provides filters to restrict the displayed images to just those
meeting the selected criteria.
The <em>Subject</em>, <em>Source</em>, and <em>Study</em> filters accept plain text input as
well as the wildcard characters <em>_</em> or <em>?</em> to represent a single unknown character, and the
wildcard characters <em>*</em> or <em>%</em> to represent zero or more unknown characters.
The <em>Reset Filters</em> button resets all filter fields to show all 3DF files in the database.
The currently selected image (row) can be loaded by
clicking the <em>Load Image</em> button, or by double clicking the table row itself.
Note that Cliniface only allows a maximum of two images to be loaded at once.
</p>
<p>
The information in each row shows from left to right the local path of the 3DF file,
the date the image was taken, the subject identifier, the image source (if not blank), and the
study identifier (if not blank) associated with the image. Every image is allocated
a subject identifier if not provided starting with the string: _UNKNOWN_. Clicking the column
headings in the table sorts the table contents by that field (subsequent clicks toggle the
sort order).
