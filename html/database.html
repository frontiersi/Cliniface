<center><h1>Image Browser</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Cliniface's database of images can be accesed from the <em>File</em> menu by selecting
<em>Image Browser</em> or by pressing the <em>TAB</em> key.
Upon startup, the existing image database is loaded which contains the paths to any 3DF
files opened in Cliniface during the last session as well as any 3DF files discovered
within directories added to the database. Upon first use (or if the database is empty
at startup) the example images supplied with Cliniface will be added to the database
and displayed. A thumbnail image of the subject from the selected row is shown in the bottom
right of the dialog. Left double clicking a row in the table loads that image file or the
selected file can be loaded by clicking the <em>Load Selected Image</em> button.
Note that Cliniface allows a maximum of two images to be loaded at once.

<h2>Adding 3DF files to the database</h2>
<p>
Click <em>Reset Database</em> to clear the existing database of all image references. Note that
this will only remove the file references from the database without deleting the files themselves.
New 3DFs can be added to the database either by manually loading a 3DF file in the normal way from
Cliniface's main menu, or by clicking the <em>Add Directory</em> button whereupon you will be asked
to select a directory to recursively parse for 3DF files. Metadata from each discovered 3DF file
is read and loaded into the database. Note that this may take a while if the selected directory
contains a very large number of 3DF files, or if the directory is on non-local storage (e.g., on
network attached storage).
</p>
<p>
Only 3DF files can be added to the database. 3D images in other file
formats must first be saved to 3DF either by loading them individually in the normal way and
then saving to 3DF format, or by using Cliniface's command line interface to convert the image
to 3DF format.
</p>

<h2>Searching the image database</h2>
<p>
The bottom section of the dialog provides filters to restrict the displayed images to just those
meeting the selected criteria.
The <em>Subject</em>, <em>Source</em>, and <em>Study</em> filters accept plain text input as
well as the wildcard characters <em>_</em> or <em>?</em> to represent a single unknown character, and the
wildcard characters <em>*</em> or <em>%</em> to represent zero or more unknown characters.
The <em>Clear Filters</em> button resets all filter fields to show all 3DF files in the database.
</p>
<p>
The information in each row shows from left to right the local path of the 3DF file,
the date the image was taken, the subject identifier, the image source (if not blank), and the
study identifier (if not blank) associated with the image. Every image is allocated
a subject identifier if not provided starting with the string: _UNKNOWN_. Clicking the column
headings in the table sorts the table contents by that field (subsequent clicks toggle the
sort order).
