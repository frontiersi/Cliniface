Cliniface is free and open source software. It was developed to connect
the needs of patients and medical professionals with the insights and
achievements of researchers. If your work is related to facial measurement
and analysis, then integrating it into Cliniface will widen its exposure
and allow it to help real people with real medical conditions. We are
eager to collaborate with those who see the potential to extend Cliniface
in new and exciting directions. Contact us now to discuss how we can build
the future of 3D facial analysis together.
