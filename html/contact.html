Cliniface is free and open source software. It was developed to connect the needs of
patients and medical professionals with the insights and achievements of researchers.
If your work is related to facial measurement and analysis, then integrating it into
Cliniface will give it international reach and allow it to be used to help real people
with real medical conditions. We are eager to collaborate with individuals and
groups who see the potential for Cliniface to be extended in new and exciting ways.
Contact us now to discuss how we can build the future of 3D facial analysis together.
