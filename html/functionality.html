<center><h1>Summary of Functionality</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>
Cliniface's interface is comprised of menus and toolbars below which is the viewing region for 3D images.
Up to two models can be loaded at once and each is initially placed in its own viewer. The selected model
is shown inside a blue bounding box and its file path is shown in the application titlebar. The selected
model can be moved or copied to an adjacent viewer using the buttons below the viewer.
Clicking one of the viewers makes its model the currently selected one.
Beneath each viewer is a dropdown list of the file paths of its displayed models. If both models are
in the same viewer, this can be used to select between them.
</p>
<p>
Greyed out buttons or actions are currently unavailable. The toolbar buttons provide quick
access to the more commonly used actions. Actions are carried out on the currently selected model.
The image below shows the interface with two models - the right viewer showing the models overlaid.
Note that the viewer divider can be dragged horizontally to show more of either viewer. See the key
below the image for descriptions of the numbered elements.
