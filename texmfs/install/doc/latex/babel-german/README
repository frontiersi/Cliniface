== PURPOSE ==

This bundle is an extension to the babel package for multilingual
typesetting. It provides all necessary macros, definitions and settings
to typeset German documents. The bundle includes support for the
traditional and reformed German orthography as well as for the Austrian
and Swiss varieties of German.


== CONTENTS ==

The bundle consists of the following files:

* german.ins (installation file to unpack the language definition
  files)
* germanb.dtx (packed language definition files and
  documentation for the traditional [1901--1996] orthography)
* ngermanb.dtx (packed language definition files and
  documentation for the reformed [1996 ff.] orthography)
* germanb.pdf: unpacked documentation for germanb.ldf (support
  for traditional orthography)
* ngermanb.pdf: unpacked documentation for ngermanb.ldf (support
  for new orthography)
* README (this file)
