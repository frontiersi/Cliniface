Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source to produce
many forms of output:
- a PDF or DVI document (via the TeX typesetting system) with the normal
  features of a book, including sectioning, cross references, indices, etc.
- an Info file with analogous features to make documentation browsing easy.
- a plain text (ASCII) file.
- an HTML output file suitable for use with a web browser.
- a Docbook file.
- a XML file transliterating the source with a Texinfo DTD.

See ./INSTALL* for installation instructions.

To get started with Texinfo, best is to read the Texinfo manual;
it is online at http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo.
If you don't have Internet access, you can read the manual locally:
- first, build the distribution.
- then, for HTML, run: make -C doc html
  and you can start reading at doc/texinfo.html/index.html.
- for PDF, if you have a working TeX, run: make -C doc pdf
- for Info, you can read a tutorial on reading Info files:
 ./info/ginfo doc/info
  and/or read the Texinfo manual:
 ./info/ginfo doc/texinfo

Texinfo mailing lists and archives:
- http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-texinfo
  for bug reports, enhancement suggestions, technical discussion.
- http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-texinfo
  for authoring questions and general discussion.
There are no corresponding newsgroups.

Bug reports:
Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of all input files needed to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a statement of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware and operating system information (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (try ./config.status --help).
- anything else that you think could be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

See README-hacking for information on the Texinfo development
environment -- any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a
programmer and wish to contribute, this should get you started.  If
you're not a programmer, you can still make significant contributions by
writing test cases, checking the documentation against the
implementation, etc.

This distribution includes the following files, among others:
    README                 This file.
    README-hacking         Texinfo developer information.

    INSTALL                Texinfo-specific installation notes.
    NEWS                   Summary of new features by release.

Texinfo documentation files (in ./doc):
    texinfo.texi           Describes the Texinfo language and many
                           of the associated tools.  It tells how to use
                           Texinfo to write documentation, how to use
                           Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, TeX,
                           texi2any/makeinfo, and much else.

    info.texi              Describes how to read manuals in Info.
                           This document also comes as part of GNU Emacs.

    info-stnd.texi         How to use the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                           included in this distribution (./info).

Printing-related files:
    doc/texinfo.tex        This implements Texinfo in TeX, to typeset a
                           Texinfo file into a DVI or PDF file.

    util/texi2dvi          This is a shell script for producing an
                           indexed DVI file using TeX and texindex.
    
    util/texi2pdf          Generate PDF (wrapper for texi2dvi).

Source directories: 
  djgpp/                   Support for compiling under DJGPP.
  gnulib/                  Support files from Gnulib.
  info/                    Standalone Info reader.
  install-info/            Maintain the Info dir file.
  tp/                      Texinfo Parser in Perl, includes texi2any/makeinfo.
  texindex/                The `texindex' program that generates
                           sorted indices used by TeX when
                           typesetting a file for printing.

Translation support:
  po/                      Strings of the programs.
  po_document/             Strings in generated Texinfo documents.

Installation support:
  Makefile.am              Read by Automake to create a Makefile.in.
  Makefile.in              Read by configure to make a Makefile,
                             created by Automake.
  configure.ac             Read by Autoconf to create `configure'.
  configure                Configuration script for local conditions,
                             created by Autoconf.
  build-aux/               Common files.

The util/ directory contains a few other scripts, e.g., examples of
using makeinfo in various ways.  See util/README.

Finally, the contrib/ directory contains additional files from users
provided for your reading and/or hacking pleasure.  They aren't part of
Texinfo proper or maintained by the Texinfo developers.
