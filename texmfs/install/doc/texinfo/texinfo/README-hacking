This file describes the development environment for Texinfo.

  notice and this notice are preserved.

The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
Subversion at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/svn/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest official releases.  If
you are getting the sources from the development repository (or change
configure.ac), you'll need to have these tools installed to (re)build.
You'll also need help2man.  If you modify texindex/ti.twjr, you'll need
gawk >= 4.0.  All of these programs are available from
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

After getting the development sources, and installing the tools above,
you can run
 ./autogen.sh
and then, for example,
 ./configure -C CFLAGS='-g -Wdeclaration-after-statement'
and then
 make

After the initial autogen && configure, simply running make should suffice.

The -C tells configure to cache test results, which usually speeds
things up a bit.

That particular -W is useful because a) intermixing declarations with
statements is an easy thing to do accidentally, b) gcc doesn't warn
about it by default, and c) other compilers that don't support it are
still widespread.  If you're not using gcc, of course you shouldn't
specify that option.

Other -W options can be useful too, and patches are welcome to resolve
diagnostics; however, removing all possible warning messages, or
warnings with nonfree compilers, is explicitly not a goal.

Running make in one particular subdirectory is possible, for example
make -C info.  However there are interdependencies between the 
subdirectories, notably on gnulib, so if you don't want to run "make", 
you may have to run "make -C gnulib/lib" first.

Additionally, make dist may not work until make has been run at least 
once, because of rules to create man pages under the man/ directory.

"make dist" will fail if the use of Perl XS extension modules is 
disabled and there is no Makefile in the XSParagraph subdirectory.

Gnulib
------

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files.  Gnulib files used in Texinfo are checked in to
the repository.  If you get automake/conf/etc. errors from ./autogen.sh,
please try getting a checkout of gnulib (in a separate directory from
the texinfo checkout), and then run, say,
  ../gnulib/gnulib-tool --add-import
in your top-level Texinfo directory.
(gnulib-tool is in the gnulib source tree.)

The currently-used gnulib modules and other gnulib information are
recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  Given a source checkout of
gnulib, you can update the files with gnulib-tool --add-import.

When running gnulib-tool --add-import or otherwise adding modules, it is
necessary to check what files were added (e.g., run "svn status
build-aux gnulib") and add them to the repository with "svn add";
likewise for removals, likewise for adding new generated files
(typically gnulib/lib/foo.h from foo.h.in) to the ignore list (e.g.,
  svn propedit svn:ignore gnulib/lib).


Subdirectories in repository
----------------------------

In addition to the subdirectories listed in README, there are these 
directories in the source control repository:

makeinfo/  - Implementation of makeinfo in C, distributed before version 5.0
texi2html/ - Perl program to generate HTML from Texinfo, superseded by texi2any




About running the Texinfo programs from a development source tree:

- Once the distribution is built, you can run the compiled programs
(info, install-info) out of the build tree without special settings; 
they don't try to read any installed data files.

- The texi2dvi script and texinfo.tex can be run as-is, since they 
are standalone and don't require compilation.  For the same reasons,
they are officially updated between full Texinfo releases, at
http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo.

- Regarding texi2any (aka makeinfo), you can run tp/texi2any.pl
directly.  This is the original source file for the program, so it's
convenient to be able to make changes and then run it.

To run the output "tp/texi2any" instead, you can set the environment
variable TEXINFO_DEV_SOURCE to 1.  Otherwise, it will try to use
Texinfo's Perl modules in the installed locations.  "tp/texi2any" uses
the Perl interpreter found by configure, so you might want to run that 
instead of texi2any.pl if it's different to the default interpreter in 
your environment.



References for working on various parts of the system:

If you want to delve into making a new backend for the Perl makeinfo,
the documentation in tp/Texinfo/Convert/Converter.pm is a good starting
point, as it describes the existing backends and other places to look.

If you want to delve into texinfo.tex, a thorough plain TeX reference
is available under the GFDL:
  TeX by Topic - http://www.eijkhout.net/texbytopic/texbytopic.html
Another book on plain TeX, also available under the GFDL, is a GNU package:
  TeX for the Impatient - http://www.gnu.org/software/teximpatient/
Occasionally you may need to know about the details of the PDF format.
A reference for this is the PDF reference, Sixth Edition, version 1.7,  
downloadable at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive.html

The texindex program is implemented using the TexiWebJR literate
programming system, combining Texinfo and Awk
(https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/texiwebjr).  Running "make ti.pdf"
in the texindex/ subdirectory creates the printable form of the
program.  All the usual Texinfo output formats are possible.



Steps for making a release (pretest or official):

- When close to official release:
check at latest automake/autoconf/gettext version, and mention in NEWS
special pleading with bug-texinfo / beebe / platform-testers to try.
check OpenCSW build reports at
  https://buildfarm.opencsw.org/buildbot/waterfall?category=texinfo
try groff.texinfo from groff source repo.
process doc/texinfo-tex-test.texi with TeX and check that output is good.

- First checks:
Ensure texinfo.tex, texi2dvi, and htmlxref.cnf are updated on ftp.gnu.org.
Ensure TXI_XLATE in doc/Makefile.am matches actual file list.
Check that LINGUAS under po and po_document match actual file list.
Have a look at the output of "svn status ." to check for files that
  should be tracked in SVN or ignored.
Check that TEXINFO_DTD_VERSION has been updated to the next version in
  configure.ac if the DTD has been modified since the last release.
  See comments in configure.ac, and run (at the top level) make dtd-check.
Check "make ccheck" and "make vcheck" work in "doc/refcard".
Check "dist-xz" is in the option list in configure.ac (often removed
for speed when testing).
Update copyright years in many files for release; best to grep -r for
  the previous year.  See also ChangeLog entries for "copyright years".
  No need (though it's ok) to change every source file at once, just the
  ones relevant to --version calls, etc., such as texindex.awk and info.c.
make po-check             # update po/POTFILES.in as needed

# Under the top level, and also under tp/Texinfo/Convert/XSParagraph, which
# uses a separate gnulib import.
gnulib-tool --add-import

util/srclist-txi          # for pretest, to sync files with other sources

- Official releases only:
version and date in NEWS.
version number in texi2dvi, texi2pdf, txirefcard.tex.
(cd tp && ./maintain/change_perl_modules_version.sh auto)
  -- this updates all the version numbers in the Perl modules
version number in
  tp/Texinfo/Convert/XSParagraph/configure.ac, and
  tp/Texinfo/Convert/XSParagraph/TestXS.pm
sync texi2html/test/ results with tp/.

ensure building standalone modules for CPAN still works.
make V=1 pdf and fix underfull/overfull boxes.

- Changes to sources:
update version in configure.ac, notice in ChangeLog.
check that texindex version is updated properly
  (rm texindex.awk ; make)
Check that translations have been updated, e.g.:
  rsync  -Lrtzv  translationproject.org::tp/latest/texinfo/  texinfo
  rsync  -Lrtzv  translationproject.org::tp/latest/texinfo_document/ \
                 texinfo_document
    followed by copying updated translation files to po/ and po_document/.
pod2man Pod-Simple-Texinfo/pod2texi.pl >man/pod2texi.1 # until we fix deps

check that the svn checkout is up-to-date (run "svnversion" and "svn update")
make
make update-po            # both po and po_document needed, build a dist first
make -C doc wwwdoc-build  # and -install for official (and eventual commit)
make long-checks          # distcheck does not do this
(export MALLOC_CHECK_=2; make distcheck)  # repeat until clean
svn commit                # when clean, then distcheck to be sure

- To do the actual upload:
pkg=texinfo
ver=6.0

then do one of:
gnupload --to alpha.gnu.org:$pkg $pkg-$ver.tar.xz                #pretest
gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:$pkg   $pkg-$ver.tar.{gz,xz} *.diff.xz #official
   Use --user option if not using default key
   texinfo.tex and texi2dvi should already be up to date, but check.  Use
gnupload --replace --to ftp.gnu.org:texinfo texi2dvi

#  Official releases only: tag source tree (use your own username before @):
svn copy -r 6363 -m'texinfo_6_0 tag based on r6363' \
  svn+ssh://gavin@svn.savannah.gnu.org/texinfo/trunk \
  svn+ssh://gavin@svn.savannah.gnu.org/texinfo/tags/texinfo_6_0

cvs commit -m$ver $ver

# If -kb is forgotten, CVS will do its own $Id expansion.
# Recover by editing and committing a new version of texinfo.dtd in svn,
# copying it again to the cvs dir, then:

mv -v $pkg-$ver.tar.{gz,xz}* *.diff.xz $misc/archive/$pkg/prod/  #official

- When official release is out there ...
update home page (texinfo.html) and commit as needed.
including:
  pod2html $txi/Pod-Simple-Texinfo/pod2texi.pl \
  | fgrep -v 'rev="made"' >manual/pod2texi.html
Copy documentation files to web checkout with, e.g.
  make -C doc \
  wwwdoc-install www_target=../../TEXINFO_WEB_PAGES/texinfo/manual/
Check for removed files with, e.g. ls -ltu $(www_target)/*/html_node, 
followed by cvs rm -f.  Likewise, check for added files with
cvs -qn update, followed by cvs add.  When done, run cvs commit.
