                         The luamplib generic package.


This package allows typesetting of metapost natively in the TeX documents
thanks to the LuaTeX mplib library. It works in PDF or DVI mode, but
DVIPDFMx is the only DVI tool currently supported.

This package is developed on <http://github.com/lualatex/luamplib>.
