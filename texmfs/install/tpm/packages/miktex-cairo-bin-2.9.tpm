Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB. Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension). The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.) Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but bindings are available for several different programming languages. </TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="1681562">texmf\miktex\bin\MiKTeX209-cairo.dll texmf\tpm\packages\miktex-cairo-bin-2.9.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1495915297</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>356324651106d3fc2bcb724b78cc4641</TPM:MD5><TPM:Copyright owner="University of Southern California et al." year="2002-2014"/><TPM:License type="lgpl2.1"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
