(The \urldef command provides robust commands that serve in cases when \url doesn't work in an argument.) The command is intended for email addresses, hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its argument. However, a package option “allows spaces”, which is useful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of file names.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="13058">texmf\tex\latex\url\miscdoc.sty texmf\tex\latex\url\url.sty</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="260786">texmf\doc\latex\url\url.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="5422">texmf\source\url-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1389042001</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3428eedbd741477ae327d69db2129e3a</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/url"/><TPM:License type="lppl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
