biblatex. The present release was developed for use with biblatex
1.5. Biber reads UTF-8 input, and by default produces UTF-8 output,
though it can produce LaTeX accent-command-letter combinations if
required. The CTAN distribution offers a compressed tar archive of the
sources, etc., together with binary distributions for a variety of
platforms. Note: biber is formally named biblatex-biber, to
distinguish it from an earlier (now apparently moribund) project
called biber.
