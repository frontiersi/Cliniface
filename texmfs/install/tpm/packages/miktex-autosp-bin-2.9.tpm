It simplifies the creation of MusiXTeX scores by converting (non-standard) commands of the form \anotes ... \en into one or more conventional note-spacing commands, as determined by the note values themselves, with \sk spacing commands inserted as necessary. The coding for an entire measure can be entered one part at a time, without concern for note-spacing changes within the part or spacing requirements of other parts. Included in the autosp package is a small utility rebar that reads a MusiXTeX score and generates a copy with bar-number comments of the form %barno appended to commands such as \bar, \alaligne, etc. replacing any existing comments. Bar-numbering in the MusiXTeX output is not affected. </TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="91674">texmf\miktex\bin\miktex-autosp.exe texmf\miktex\bin\miktex-rebar.exe texmf\tpm\packages\miktex-autosp-bin-2.9.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1495915297</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>5999aa50226ff9d350196339b7e302ce</TPM:MD5><TPM:Copyright owner="D.
